# Depth Analysis Node Documentation

## Overview
This Python script is a ROS (Robot Operating System) node that analyzes depth data from a depth camera and publishes the average depth value in a specified region of interest (ROI). The script subscribes to the depth image topic, extracts the ROI, and calculates the average depth value. The result is published on a new topic, `/depth_camera_value`.

## Dependencies
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Python 2 or 3
- OpenCV
- CvBridge

## Node Information
- **Node Name:** depth_analysis
- **Published Topics:**
  - `/depth_camera_value` (Float32): Publishes the average depth value in the specified ROI.
- **Subscribed Topics:**
  - `/camera/depth/image_rect_raw` (Image): Subscribes to the raw depth image topic.

## Parameters
- **ROI Size:** The size of the region of interest (ROI) is set to 100x100 pixels by default. You can adjust the size in the script.

## Execution
1. Ensure that ROS is installed and initialized.
2. Run the script using the command: `./depth_analysis_node.py`
3. The node will subscribe to the depth image topic, periodically analyze the depth data in the specified ROI, and publish the average depth value.

## Functionality
- The script converts the raw depth image data to a NumPy array.
- It defines a ROI in the middle of the image and extracts the depth data within the ROI.
- The average depth value in the ROI is calculated and published on the `/depth_camera_value` topic.

## Note
- Adjust the ROI size and the timer duration in the script based on your specific requirements.

**Important:** Ensure that the necessary dependencies, such as OpenCV and CvBridge, are installed before running the script.
